This is a personal fork of [a fork](https://github.com/johanw666/Signal-Android) of the [Android app for Signal](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android) with some extra features, mainly theme changes:

- AMOLED Dark Theme
- Material You theming on Android 12+

## TODO:
- [ ] Build and sign an APK
- [ ] Improve Material You theming
  - [ ] Make it a separate, toggleable theme, rather than on by default
  - [ ] Make a version for Light theme

See the original README [here](README%20orig.md).
