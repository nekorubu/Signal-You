# Signal Android 

Signal is a messaging app for simple private communication with friends.

Signal uses your phone's data connection (WiFi/3G/4G) to communicate securely, optionally supports plain SMS/MMS to function as a unified messenger, and can also encrypt the stored messages on your phone.

Currently available on the Play store and [signal.org](https://signal.org/android/apk/).

## WhatsApp Data Import

This is based on code contributed by Samuel Welten (https://github.com/jukefoxer/Signal-Android) and Wollwolke 
(https://github.com/Wollwolke/Signal-Android/tree/feature/wa-db-import). Thank you both for this.

This fork of the Signal App provides a method to import one's WhatsApp conversations. It's currently still a pretty tedious process, but at least it's possible.

### What works

* Import 1-to-1 text conversation threads.
* Import group chat conversations if a group chat with the same name is set up in the Signal App.
* Importing images and videos messages from WhatsApp chats.

### What doesn't work

* Multimedia messages other than images and videos are currently not imported.
* It's pretty slow (10 seconds per 1000 messages).

### How to do it

* Extract your unencrypted msgstore.db from your WhatsApp installation. There are several methods to do so. WhatsAppDump seems to offer a possibility that doesn't require rooting the device. A more detailed description of how to do so might be added here in the future.
* Copy the msgstore.db file to the top level directory of your internal storage
* Make an encrypted Backup of your Signal Messages using the built-in feature of the Signal App.
* Build and install this version of the Signal App and import the encrypted Backup of your signal messages.
* You might have to go to the app permission settings and give it the permission to manage all of the external storage.
* Go to Backup => Import WhatsApp to start the import.
* Be patient until it finishes.
* If you're happy with the WhatsApp import create another encrypted backup of all Signal messages.
* Install the original Signal app again and import the encrypted Backup.
